# BookletParser

 _Parses singlefold booklets into reading order._
 
 This utility is for parsing scans of two-page booklets. That is, booklets made of standard 8.5 x 11 sheets, folded in half and stapled along the spine. Each booklet page is then 5.5" wide by 8.5" tall.
 
 The easy way to archive such a booklet is to remove the staples and feed the stack of sheets through a scanner. However, viewing the result on-screen is awkward. The pages that are adjacent in the scan were far distant in the booklet, and vise versa. Not to mention, the sheets are sideways.
 
 This utility solves all that by taking the multi-page TIF scan, and creating a copy with the half-sheet pages divided out, rotated, and arranged in correct reading order.
