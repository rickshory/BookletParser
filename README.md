# BookletParser
 Parses scans of singlefold booklets into pages in reading order
 This utility is for parsing scans of two-page booklets. That is, booklets make of standard 8.5 x 11 sheets, folded in half and stapled along the spine. Each booklet page is then 5.5" wide by 8.5" tall.
 The easy way to scan such a booklet for archiving is to remove the staples and feed the stack of sheets through a scanner. However, viewing the result on-screen is awkward, as the pages that were adjacent in the booklet are now far distant in the scan.
 This utility solves that by taking the multi-page TIF scan, and creating a copy with the half-sheet pages divided out, rotated, and arranged in correct reading order.
